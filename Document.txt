Penn,

As I mentioned before, I am not able to finish this project in time so I will descrbe the project at this moment and send you site url and souce code when I finish it.

Generally, the project utilizes 3 layers: 
	Layer1: Retriving data from user via UI;
	Layer2: Encapsulating data into different classes like Shopping Cart, Product, Category, Customer, Guest etc.
	Layer3: Then Layer2 calls Db Connection to manage the SQL database for adding, deleting, updating or searching. (Sql Procedure is used here to replace creating slq command programmatically)

	When Layer3 is finished running, project will generate script message to inform the user of the status.
	When Default page, Add New Product page loaded, we need ask database for related information layer by layer which is similiar to former operation.

(Not finish)
Similarly, we are able to create customer instance in database which corresponds to register. Admin log in is created by default stored in Web.config
We have another 4 tables Customer, Customer_Product, Guest, Guest_Product, Customer and Guest are used for storing infomration of human. Customer_Product and Guest_Product are used for storing
mapping relationship between prodcut and customer, product and guest. Whenever, customer/guest place an order, we will have a record in the database.
If I am able to configure the project with an online SMTP server, we can send email to the customer if the email address is valid.
